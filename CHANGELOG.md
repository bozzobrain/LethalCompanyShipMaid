# Changes
- V3.2.6
	- Adjusted valid positions to include the whole ship (The rear of the ship was excluded due to assumptions from previous organization methods)
	- Improved the position bounds for edges of ship (front is narrower than the rear of ship)
	- Addressed regex not including items with nubmers in name (Specifically the Magic 7 Ball). 
	- Thanks to [jcsnider](https://github.com/jcsnider) for helping to identify these issues
